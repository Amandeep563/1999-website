      <h2>Baby's First Blocks</h2>
      <p>
        The #1024 block set replaced 1978-1988's #414 Baby's First Blocks. At
        first, the only difference between the sets was that the #1024 was sold
        with triangular blocks opposed to the square blocks sold with the #414.
        In 1997, the set was changed and sold with a new design on the canister
        (juggling teddy bear opposed to baby stacking blocks) and the blocks
        were dramatically changed. Opposed to soft hollow plastic blocks, the
        1997+ blocks have recessed sides with molded designs on the inside wall.
        The blocks can be stacked or dropped into the canister through the
        shapes in the removable lid. Measures 7-1/2" high, 5-7/16" diameter.
        Designed for children ages 6 months to 2 years old.

      <h2>PocketStation</h2>
      <p>
        The PocketStation is a memory card peripheral by Sony Interactive
        Entertainment for the PlayStation home video game console.[3] It was
        released in Japan in 1999. The device acted not only as a memory card,
        but was interactive itself via a small monochrome LCD display and
        buttons on its case. Many PlayStation games included software that could
        be downloaded and played on the PocketStation
